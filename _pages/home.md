Hi! I'm Jason, a Research Professional at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I have worked on the following projects:

#### [Conference Calls](https://github.com/jasonjiajs/conference_call_code)
A processing pipeline to download over 500k conference calls from Thomson One (Refinitiv) and identify paragraphs containing keywords related to hurdle rates.

#### [Greedier](https://github.com/jasonjiajs/CMSC_27200_Project)
A greedy algorithm that seeks to find the optimal sequence of rides through a theme park, given a set of constraints. Augmented with partial brute force, this algorithm produced outputs that ranked 2nd / 42 teams in CMSC 27200 (Theory of Algorithms).

#### [Cascades](https://github.com/jasonjiajs/CMSC-15200)
A 2-player board game played on Linux terminal. It is a generalization of Connect-Four, with a triangular board and a new "Earthquake" ability that shakes up the board. This is the final project in CMSC 15200 (Introduction to Computer Science II).

#### [Inflation under FIRE: Deviations and Explanations](https://rationale.lse.ac.uk/articles/abstract/35/)
A paper that reconciles seemingly contradictory conclusions from empirical evidence on deviations of inflation expectations from the Full-Information Rational Expectations (FIRE) hypothesis, based on the methodology of Angeletos, Huo and Sastry (2020).

#### [Online Learning](https://github.com/jasonjiajs/online_learning)
A list of online programs and courses taken for personal learning.
